Iâ€™ve tested the code in chrome, Firefox, Microsoft edge browser and safari as well as the mobile versions of these browsers. I used W3C for CSS https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/and HTML https://validator.w3.org/ to remove errors.
The other elements of the project including the messaging serving, listing of houses and email contact page i've extensively tested myself for errors.
The listings pages  and contact pages have been tested to make sure the required fields need to be fulfilled for listings to be sumitted and for emails to send.
