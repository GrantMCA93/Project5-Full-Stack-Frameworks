#Testing
Iâ€™ve tested the code in chrome, Firefox, Microsoft edge browser and safari as well as the mobile versions of these browsers. I used W3C for CSS https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/and HTML https://validator.w3.org/ to remove errors.
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
